## Project Summary
Thoughts is a full-stack news/blog site. The back-end, built following TDD in using express.js, postgreSQL and jest(for the testing), has endpoints for managing users, comments and articles. The front-end, built with react exploring react-router v6.4 features, is a mobile-first designed page with sign-in, comment and upvote functionality.

I'm proud of the skills and knowledge in this project which has taken just under 10 days to bring to this point. I think it demonstrates solid abilities and understanding of full-stack architecture, design best practises and test-driven development.  

Obviously, this is only a beginning and I look forward to developing all these skills and increasing my knowledge. There are, of course, other features that I would like to add but I hope you'll agree it a good start!

Please take a look around the hosted site or the repo and let me know your thoughts or any bugs spotted [here](https://github.com/lw1066/Thoughts/issues) thanks.
